Fingers menu - actions literally at your fingertips. Works really well in cases where you want to have your field-of-view as clean as possible. No solvers or voice commands. Just flip your palms over and have your buttons ready. Each hand works autonomously - no more interactions like holding one panel with one hand and clicking the buttons with the other. During our test sessions we figured out this UX approach works really well. There is no learning curve. Just touch your finger with your thumb..
